abstract="Support-based clustering has recently absorbed plenty of attention because of its applications in solving the difficult and diverse clustering or outlier detection problem. Support-based clustering method perambulates two phases: finding the domain of novelty and performing the clustering assignment. To find the domain of novelty, the training time given by the current solvers is typically over-quadratic in the training size. This fact impedes the application of support-based clustering method to the large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose applying stochastic gradient descent framework to the first phase of support-based clustering for finding the domain of novelty in the form of a half-space and a new strategy to perform the clustering assignment. We validate our proposed method on several well-known datasets for clustering task to show that the proposed method renders a comparable clustering quality to the baselines while being faster than them.",
